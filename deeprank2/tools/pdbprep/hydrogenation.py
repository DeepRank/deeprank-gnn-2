#           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
#           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
#           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
#           the Derivative Works; and

#       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
#           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

#           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
#           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
#           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
#           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
#           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
#           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
#           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
#           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
#           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
#           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
#           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
#           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
#           as modifying the License.

#       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
#       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
#       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
#       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
#       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
#       the conditions stated in this License.

#    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
#       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
#       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
#       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
#       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
#       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
#       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

#       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

#       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

#       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
#       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

#       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
#       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
#       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
#       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
#       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
#       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
#       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
#       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
#       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
#       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

#    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
#       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
#       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
#       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
#       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
#       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
#       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
#       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
#       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
#       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
