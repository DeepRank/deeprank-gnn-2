Deeprank-Core |version| documentation
========================================

Deeprank-Core is a deep learning framework for data mining Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) using Graph Neural Networks. 

Deeprank-Core contains useful APIs for pre-processing PPIs data, computing features and targets, as well as training and testing GNN models.

Main features:

* Predefined atom-level and residue-level PPI feature types (e.g. atomic density, vdw energy, residue contacts, PSSM, etc.)
* Predefined target type (e.g. binary class, CAPRI categories, DockQ, RMSD, FNAT, etc.)
* Flexible definition of both new features and targets
* Graphs feature mapping
* Efficient data storage in HDF5 format
* Support both classification and regression (based on `PyTorch`_ and `PyTorch Geometric`_)
